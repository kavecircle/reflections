How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's show the line that got differece words.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Get old version (no bug) back to live.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can understand what's going on each version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Known state of files at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff [older id] [newer id]

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    can check previous version by git checkout

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
